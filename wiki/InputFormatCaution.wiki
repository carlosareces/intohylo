The input format used in HTab 1.5 enables the user to define relations with certains conditions. Nevertheless, HTab does not handle, as of now, every constraint. For instance, the following:

{{{
r ,
inv : { inverseof r , transitive }
}}}

does not enforce r to be transitive. In fact, inv will also not be transitive. The accepter way of doing so is:

{{{
r : {transitive },
inv : { inverseof r }
}}}

So the rule of thumb is : specify relation properties at the highest level in the "hierarchy of definitions".

HTab accepts interaction between transitive closures and converse of formulas, for instance:

{{{
r ,
inv : {inverseof r},
invtr : { trclosureof inv}
}}}

and


{{{
r ,
tr : {trclosureof r},
invtr : { inverseof tr}
}}}

will work as expected. But deep combinations will not work:

{{{
r , 
tr : {trclosureof r},
invtr : { inverseof tr},
tr2 : {trclosureof invtr },
invtr2 : { inverseof tr2}
}}}
