This suite of tools consists of:

  * hylores : a resolution-based theorem prover for the hybrid logic H(@,A,D,◇¯,↓)
  * htab : a tableaux-based theorem prover for the hybrid logic H(@,A,↓) with role inclusion
  * hylolib : the common library used by the other provers
  * gridtest : a framework to test and compare provers on a single machine or a grid

These tools can be obtained from the [Home page of the project](http://www.glyc.dc.uba.ar/intohylo/).
